In this thesis, searches for the exclusive Standard Model (SM) and charged hMSSM Higgs bosons are performed. 
While observations of the SM Higgs boson in 2012 by ATLAS and CMS collaborations 
were ground-breaking, several of the SM Higgs boson properties such as its coupling strengths and branching ratios 
of its decays still carry large systematic uncertainties. Higgs boson candidates from exclusive production 
could lower these systematic uncertainties due to their cleaner production environment, 
improving knowledge of the SM Higgs boson sector.
Since the charged Higgs boson is not included in the SM, its evidence 
would clearly indicate physics beyond the SM which could address the hierarchy 
problem.
%The search for the exclusive Higgs boson is conducted in data from proton-proton 
%collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), running at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqs=8\TeV$, which 
%was collected with the ATLAS detector in 2012. This data-set corresponds to an integrated 
%luminosity of 20.3~\ifb. Candidate events are chosen to have exactly one electron and one muon.
%The search for the charged Higgs boson is conducted in data from the LHC as well, 
%running at $\sqs=13\TeV$, which 
%was collected with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. This data-set corresponds to an integrated 
%luminosity of 14.7~\ifb. Candidate events are chosen to include a $\tau$ lepton and some missing transverse energy.
Since no signal is observed for either of these bosons, limits to their production cross sections 
are set. A 95\% confidence-level upper limit on the total production cross-section for exclusive 
Higgs boson is set to 1.2~pb. Limits on the total production 
cross section of the charged Higgs boson times its branching ratio to $\tau\nu$ 
are set between 1.9~pb and 15~fb, for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from 200 to 2000~\GeV.
