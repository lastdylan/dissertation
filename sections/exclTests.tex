\par The exclusivity selection introduced in the previous section was tested for several 
inconsistencies in data and simulation. First, since background rejection with this selection in 
simulation is dependent on the modelling of the underlying event, it is reasonable to 
expect difference in performance in different Monte Carlo generators as well as in data. 
Second, the equivalent photon approximation (EPA) is known to overestimate the cross section of 
elastic processes such as elastic di-leptons or elastic \Wpm\ pairs~\cite{Dyndal,Harland-Lang:2015cta}.
It was worthwhile to reproduce this over-estimation using \DZ\ as a cross check.  
Third, SD and DD Monte Carlo simulation for exclusive \Wpm\ pairs is not available. A mechanism to estimate 
these contributions was developed in the context of \DZ. 

\par This section discusses three studies. The underlying event modelling in several 
Monte Carlo generators were calibrated to match the underlying event in data. The EPA 
overestimation of elastic cross sections were reproduced using the \DZ\ selection criteria. 
SD and DD contributions to the exclusive \Wpm\ pairs was estimated. These three studies 
essentially tested the perfomance of \DZ\ and enabled its calibration.  

\subsubsection{Calibration of the underlying event}
\par To calibrate the underlying event modelling across different generators, \Zmm\ events in data 
were used for comparison. \Zee\ samples were also used separately to cross check the results. The reason for 
using Z events is that while they are a good source of leptons, they are so many in data that 
statistical uncertainties are kept at a minimum. The Z events were isolated by requiring each of the two muons 
to have at least 20~\GeV\ in \pt\ and have $80<m_{\mu\mu}<100~\GeV$. \DZ\ was then applied, essentially 
requiring no unmatched tracks in $\pm\Delta z_0<1$ mm. The $\pm\Delta z_0$ window was varied to study 
systematic uncertainties on the results. 

\par The following generators were used to simulate \Zmm\ events :
\begin{enumerate}
\item \AlpgenPythiaSix; 
\item \AlpgenHerwig;
\item \SHERPA;
\item and \POWHEG+\PYTHIAeight.
\end{enumerate} 
Figure~\ref{fig:zsubcut} shows the agreement between data and simulations from these generators. 
Circles and squares are respectively before and after the exclusivity selection was applied. Before 
exclusivity, all the generators predict \Zmm\ events to a reasonable agreement with data. After 
exclusivity, several disagreements between data and simulation, and also between simulations from the 
different generators, were observed. This is a symptom of poor underlying event modelling.  

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{The rejection of \Zmm\ between data and simulation. Simulated samples are normalized to the
data. Circles are before \DZ\ was applied, and squares are after \DZ\ was applied}
\label{fig:zsubcut}
\end{figure}

\par The fraction of events that passed \DZ\ in simulation, $n^{exc}_{MC}/n^{inc}_{MC}$, and the fraction of events 
that passed \DZ\ in data, $n^{exc}_{data}/n^{inc}_{data}$, were compared through scale factors   

\begin{equation}
f^{sim}_{n_{trk}} = \frac{n^{exc}_{MC}/n^{inc}_{MC}}{n^{exc}_{data}/n^{inc}_{data}}, 
\label{eqn:rsf}
\end{equation}
where {\it sim} is $P$ for \POWHEG+\PYTHIAeight, $AH$ for \AlpgenHerwig, AP for \AlpgenPythiaSix,
and $S$ for \SHERPA. $n_{trk}$ is the number of tracks required in the exclusivity window, 0 
being the nominal. To improve the statistical uncertainties after \DZ, measurements with $n_{trk}$ equal 
to 1 and 1$\to$4 were also done. Exclusivity window sizes other than 1 mm were used to study 
the impact of systematic uncertainties on the results. Results for this study are shown in 
Table~\ref{tbl:rejscale}.

\par To use the scale factors in Table~\ref{tbl:rejscale} to calibrate processes other than $Z$ decays 
these scale factors were extrapolated to a wider di-muon mass range. In particular, the stability of event
yields after imposing \DZ\ at di-muon masses other than between 80 and 100~\GeV needed to be quantified. These simulation yields 
 were measured in bins of $44\to60~\GeV$, $60\to90~\GeV$, $90\to116~\GeV$ and $116\to200~\GeV$. In all bins, \SHERPA had the 
minimal statistical uncertainties, so its results were compared to those from the other three generators. Quantities 
shown in Table~\ref{tab:gencm} are ratios of yields from the different generators to the yields from \SHERPA after 
the \DZ\ selection. A generous 20\% variation on the nominal yield (\SHERPA) covers yields from all other 
generators.

\subsubsection{Di-lepton check}
\label{sec:acofit}
\par As mentioned above, the EPA is known to overestimate the elastic contribution to exclusive processes 
that occur by exchanging a pair of photons. This section discusses a study that reproduces this overestimation 
within uncertainties, thereby validating \DZ. 

\par Since elastic, SD and DD Monte Carlo simulation samples for exclusive di-leptons were available, exclusive 
di-leptons were used for this study. The strategy was to isolate exclusive di-muons in data, entangle the 
elastic component, and compare it with the prediction from EPA. From this comparison, a scale factor than normalizes 
the EPA prediction to data was extracted and compared to previous studies of a similar nature. The basic selection required 
that each of the muons have $\pt>20~\GeV$, $m_{\mu\mu}>45~\GeV$ excluding a $\pm15~\GeV$ window around the 
\Zboson\ mass, and \DZ. Elastic di-muons tend to populate the low \pTmumu\ region, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:ptL}, where all the basic selection criteria described above were applied. 
So, a selection of $\pTmumu<3~\GeV$ was additionally applied.  
The major background 
to the exclusive di-muons in this region was Drell-Yan di-muons; every other background was negligible.  
Clearly, in Figure~\ref{fig:ptL} there is an overestimation of processes from simulation. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ptmumuL.eps}
\caption{Plots showing the exclusive (1.0 mm) di-muon $p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu\mu}$ distributions predicted and observed. The
  highest bin includes overflow. No scale factors are applied to
  elastic or SD or DD predictions}
\label{fig:ptL}
\end{figure}

\par Acoplanarity, defined as $1-\Delta\phi_{\mu\mu}/\pi$, is a good discriminant when disentangling elastic 
from SD and DD processes. This is expected, since $\Delta\phi_{\mu\mu}$ is dependent on \pTmumu. In this study, 
acoplanarity distributions from simulation after applying the selection criteria described in the preceding paragraphs   
were fit to the acoplanarity distribution from data, after the same selection criteria was applied. 
The yields from the fit were then extracted, comparing the elastic prediction to data minus everything else. 

\par The acoplanarity distributions before the fit are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:shapes}. Clearly, SD, DD and 
Drell-Yan have similar shapes. For the fit, SD, DD and Drell-Yan contributions were summed up and treated as 
one process. The Drell-Yan background was varied by $\pm20\%$ to evaluate systematic variations in modelling 
$f^{sim}_{n_{trk}}$. The binning and range of acoplanarity distributions were also varied to evaluate 
systematic uncertainties. These uncertainties were shown to impact results by about 7\%. 
Figure~\ref{fig:dilepAcoFit3Shape} shows the post-fit acoplanarity distributions, with 
simulation stacked on top of each other and the total agreeing with the data. From this fit a scale factor 
 $f_{EL}$ = 0.76 $\pm0.04$ (stat.) $\pm0.07$ (sys.) was extracted. This value agrees within uncertainties with 
previous predictions~\cite{Dyndal}, which cover a range between 0.73 and 0.75.

 \label{fig:dilepAcoFit3Shape}
\end{figure}                                        

\par A separate study independent of the fit method was also done to test the robustness of \fEL. 
This involved making an explicit selection based on acoplanarity in addition to the basic requirements 
already discussed above, counting the yields and re-calculating an estimate to \fEL. For acoplanarity less than 0.003, 
899 events were observed in data, 764 elastic dimuons were predicted by EPA, and 340, 67 and 64 SD, DD and Drell-Yan 
events were also predicted respectively. This corresponds to an estimate to \fEL\ of 
 $0.71 \pm0.03 \text{(stat)} \pm0.01 \text{(sys)}$. 
Similarly, tightening the acoplanarity selection to be less than 0.0015 yielded 0.73 $\pm0.03 \text{(stat)} \pm0.01 \text{(sys)}$.
These results fall well within the uncertainties of the results obtained from the fit method. 

\par \DZ\ was tested for robustness against pileup by testing its performance in events with a selection identical to 
the one prior to the fit plus an acoplanarity cut, with the difference that one extra track was allowed in the exclusivity 
window. For exclusive processes, this extra track has to be from pileup because there is no underlying 
event. As such, the $\Delta z_0$ between this extra track and the di-lepton vertex is expected to be 
uniformly distributed, showing no clear peaks. Figure~\ref{fig:dzEventOneTrk} shows the  $\Delta z_0$ 
distributions for the extra track in exclusive and \Zmm\ events. For exclusive processes these 
distributions are uniform while for \Zmm\ a they peak at 0. This shows that for \Zmm\ the extra track 
is from the underlying event. The acoplanarity cut was tightened and loosened and an estimate of \fEL\ was 
computed at each variation. All the \fEL\ estimates fell within $\pm10\%$, showing that \DZ\ has an a 10\% 
pileup uncertainty.

          extra track within 3~mm.  The exclusive predictions are
 scaled by a factor of 0.70}
 \label{fig:dzEventOneTrk}
\end{figure}

\par Since electrons are also in the signal final state, these studies were repeated using 
\Zee\ events. Due to the fact that electrons undergo brehmsstrahlung at a much higher rate than 
muons, results in the \Zee\ channel carried a much higher error. In particular, when an electron 
radiates a photon (which pair produces electrons), the extra track that the radiated electron produces 
in the ID may be counted as an extra track by \DZ. This phenomenon is referred to here as 
{\it electron self-veto}. For acoplanarity less than 0.003 the estimate to \fEL\ obtained 
through \Zee\ events was about 0.67. For acoplanarity less than 0.0015 it was 0.68. These results 
correspond to a $3.0\pm 2.5\%$ difference with the results obtained from \Zmm. This difference was 
taken as the uncertainty due to the electron self-vetoing itself.   

\subsubsection{Photon flux}
\label{sec:flux}
\par This section discusses the estimation of SD and DD \Wpm\ contributions to the exclusive 
\Wpm\ pair production. This is an important estimation because it propagates to the estimation of 
the exclusive \Wpm\ pair contamination in the exclusive Higgs boson signal region.  

\par Since exclusive di-lepton production is identical to exclusive $\WW$ production, 
this study was conducted with exclusive di-leptons. The results were then 
applied to exclusive $\WW$. The strategy was to isolate exclusive di-leptons with high mass  
in data and taking the ratio of the data minus background to the elastic di-lepton prediction. 
This ratio was then applied to the elastic $\WW$ prediction to account for the SD and DD contributions. 
As before the leptons used were di-muons, each of at least 20~\GeV\ in \pt. To suppress di-muons from 
$\WW$ decays, $m_{\mu\mu}$ was required to be at least 160~\GeV. After applying \DZ, 244 events were 
observed in data were 17.4 was predicted to be from Drell-Yan, 0.4 from inclusive $\WW$ and 2.4 from exclusive 
$\WW$. The predictions were corrected using the $f^{sim}_{n_{trk}}$ calibrations. From these quantities a scale factor 

\begin{equation}
 \fgam = \frac{N_{\mathrm{Data}} 
              - N^{\POWHEG}_{\mathrm{Background}}}{N^{\HERWIGPP}_{\mathrm{Elastic}}} \Bigg\rvert_{m_{\mu\mu} > 160~\GeV}
            = 3.30 \pm 0.22 \mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.06 \mathrm{(sys.)},
 \label{eqn:fgamma}
\end{equation}
was calculated, where $N_{\mathrm{Data}}$ is the number of events in data, 
$N_{\mathrm{Background}}^{\POWHEG}$ is the expected number of
background events, 
and $N_{\mathrm{Elastic}}^{\HERWIGPP}$ is the expected number of elastic $\yymumu$ candidates
directly from \HERWIGPP, i.e, the unscaled EPA prediction. 
Drell-Yan processes were the major contribution to the total background events and inclusive 
and exclusive $\WW$ contributed less than 10\%. To estimate the systematic uncertainties, the Drell-Yan 
contribution was varied by $\pm20\%$. Figure~\ref{fig:fluxM160} shows the $m_{\mu\mu}$ and 
$m_{ee}$ distributions for the exclusive di-leptons after applying \fEL\ to the elastic contribution 
and scaling the SD distribution such that the sum of the elastic and SD contributions corresponds 
to $\fgam \times N_{\mathrm{Elastic}}^{\HERWIGPP}$. These corrected predictions agree very well with the data. 

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/flux_m160mumu.eps} 
 \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/flux_m160ee.eps} 
 \caption{Plots of the dilepton invariant mass distribution for muon
 candidates (left) and 
          electron candidates (right). The elastic yield is scaled 
          by $\fEL = 0.76$ and the SD distribution is scaled to
          bring the sum of the elastic and SD contributions to the 
          \HERWIGPP prediction for the elastic process multiplied by
          the $\fgam$ factor in the mass region above
          160~\GeV. The last bin includes overflow}
 \label{fig:fluxM160}
\end{figure}

\par The distributions in Figure~\ref{fig:fluxM160} show that while \fgam\ was extracted from the 
invariant di-lepton mass greater than 160~\GeV, its value is rather insensitive to this choice of 
cut.

\par From the above-mentioned di-muon sample in data, the \DZ\ selection efficiency was measured. It was 
observed to be $0.58\pm0.06$, where the 10\% uncertainty arose from pileup modelling. This measurement 
agrees very well with the \DZ\ efficiency measured 
in the exclusive Higgs boson signal samples.
