ATLAS~\cite{PERF-2007-01} is a multipurpose cylindrical detector built around one 
of the LHC collision points; this particular collision point is referred to 
as Point 1 (P1) in this thesis. The ATLAS detector comprises a group of pixel detectors 
 and drift-tubes for tracking, calorimeters for energy measurements, and the muon spectrometer 
dedicated to muon tracking. The coordinate system used to describe this composite 
arrangement of sub-detectors is a right-handed one with the origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) 
in the center of the detector and the $z$-axis along the beam direction. The $x$-axis 
points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring
and the $y$-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates ($r,\phi$) are used in the transverse ($x,y$) plane,
$\phi$ being the azimuthal angle around the $z$-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle
$\theta$ as $\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)$. The angular distance $\Delta R$ in the $\eta$-$\phi$ space is defined as 
$\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2 + (\Delta\phi)^2}$. Figure~\ref{fig:coord} illustrates this arrangement.
