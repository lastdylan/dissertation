\par Evidence for the exclusive Higgs boson was searched for in events in which the Standard Model 
Higgs boson decays to a pair of \Wpm\ bosons, which in turn decay leptonically. This leptonic 
decay includes $\tau$ leptons, but only those that decay leptonically. Effectively, the final state leptons 
are electrons and muons. The topology for this decay channel is therefore 

\begin{equation}
gg\to[H]\to[\Wplus][\Wminus]\to[l][l][\met],
\label{eq:topExclH}
\end{equation} 
 
where $l$ represents the leptons: $\mu$ or $e$. 

\par The topology in Equation~\ref{eq:topExclH} is the same topology used to search for the inclusive 
Higgs boson in Ref~\cite{ATLAS:2014aga}. The event selection criteria in this analysis mimics the same 
selection criteria in Ref~\cite{ATLAS:2014aga}. Here, the flavor of the two leptons was required to be 
opposite to suppress backgrounds from \Zee\ or \Zmm\ events. Signal events were therefore required to have only 
two leptons of different flavor satisfying the selection criteria outlined in Section~\ref{sec:objExclH}.
The impact parameters of the lepton tracks with respect to the beamline in the ID, $z_0$, 
were required to be less than 1.0~mm from each other. In addition, the charges of the two leptons 
were required to be opposite because the SM Higgs boson is neutral to electromagnetic charge.  

\par Of the two leptons in signal events, the one with the largest \pt is referred to as the {\it leading} 
lepton, otherwise it is the {\it sub-leading} lepton. The leading lepton was required to have at least 
25~\GeV\ in \pt\ and the sub-leading lepton was required to have at least 15~\GeV\ in \pt. Moreover, the mass 
of the di-lepton system, \mll, was required to be at least 10~\GeV. 
This selection is referred to as the {\it pre-selection}.
Recalling that only different flavor lepton 
pairs are considered, the symbol \mll\ is used interchangeably with \memu\ to represent the transverse 
mass of the di-lepton system.

\label{fig:preselExclH}
\end{figure}

\par Figure~\ref{fig:preselExclH} shows expected distributions for several kinematic quantities for background 
and signal after the pre-selection criteria has been applied. Contributions from all the backgrounds are stacked on each 
other to total the Standard Model (SM) prediction. The hashed lines on the SM prediction is the statistical 
uncertainty, obtained by assuming that the predicted number of events follow a Poisson distribution. 
The signal prediction is not stacked on the background, and is scaled by 200 for better visibility. 
While these distributions were predicted by simulation, a full discussion on background 
treatment is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:bkgExclH}.

\par The mass of the di-lepton system, \memu, has already been introduced above. While most of the backgrounds 
have reasonably high \memu, almost all the signal is 
expected to fall in the $\memu<100~\GeV$ region, after all the pre-selection criteria has been applied. 
In particular, the $WW$ distributions tend to have high \memu\ than the signal. This is expected because with a 
spin-0 quantum number, the Higgs boson decays to final state leptons that have a smaller angular separation 
than the leptons from $WW$ decays. This small angular separation lowers \memu.   
This hints 
towards additional selection criteria dependent on the mass and angular separation of the di-lepton system.
Figure~\ref{fig:preselExclH} shows both \memu\ and \dFem, where most of the signal lies in the 
region $\dFem<2.0$.      

\par The transverse mass, \mT, of the di-lepton-\met\ system shown in Figure~\ref{fig:preselExclH} 
is defined as  

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mT}
  \mT = \sqrt{(E_{\mathrm T}^{e\mu}+\met)^{2} - |\boldsymbol{\pTemu} + \boldsymbol{ p_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss}}}|^{2}},
\end{equation}
where $E_{\mathrm T}^{e\mu} = \sqrt{|\boldsymbol{\pTemu}|^{2}+m_{e\mu}^{2}}$ and $|\boldsymbol{ p_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss}}}|=\met$. 
This quantity essentially is the mass of the Higgs boson, so it is expected to peak at 125~\GeV\ and have 
a small tail that is mostly in the region $\mT<140~\GeV$.

\par The transverse mass of the di-lepton system, \pTll\ or \pTemu, 
is expected to be relatively higher for signal than it is for backgrounds such as $V$+jets and 
exclusive di-leptons. QCD multi-jets, not shown in Figure~\ref{fig:preselExclH}, are also expected 
to have low \pTemu\ when the jets are mis-identified as leptons. To suppress these backgrounds, a selection 
of $\pTemu>30~\GeV$ was imposed.  

\par A dedicated selection was also developed to separate exclusive from inclusive events. This criterion 
is referred to here as the {\it exclusivity selection} or \DZ\ in short. Its perfomance in simulation and 
data was tested, and is formally introduced in the next two sections.   

\par From the distributions in Figure~\ref{fig:preselExclH} the following additional selection were applied to 
isolate Higgs-like events from the $\WW$ spectrum: $\mll<55~\GeV$, $\mT<140~\GeV$ and $\dFll<1.8$. This selection 
was found to be optimal without any additional 
 \met\ criteria.  

\par Table~\ref{tab:evSel} summarizes all the selection criteria discussed in this section. 
Figure~\ref{fig:prelimMT} shows the expected \mT\ distributions in the signal region, minus 
the \mT\ selection criterion. Modified distributions will be shown in later sections after 
several calibrations and corrections have been applied to the background processes. In any case, exclusive 
and inclusive $\WW$ was expected to dominanate the background processes that contaminated 
the signal region.

\subsection{Exclusivity Selection}
\par The exclusivity selection developed in this analysis is based on the final state particles 
shown in the topology in Equation~\ref{eq:topExclH}. With only two leptons in the final state, these 
exclusive events are expected to have exactly two tracks in the event. These tracks are in turn expected 
to be matched to the said leptons.  

\par As mentioned in previous sections, tracks in this analysis were parametrized by impact parameters 
measured with respect to the beamline. It is worth mentioning that the most common track 
parametrization in ATLAS is with respect to the primary vertex (PV), defined as the vertex with the 
highest track sum \pt. The default ATLAS primary vertex is referred to as PV in this text, and the vertex from which two tracks 
in exclusive processes originate is referred to as the di-lepton vertex. The 
probability that a track from pileup events is mistakenly associated with the PV, especially 
in events that have few tracks, is substantial. When that happens, the position of the PV in 
the $z$ coordinate may get distorted. This, as will be shown in the next paragraphs, would reduce 
the efficiency of the exclusivity selection. So an effort to refrain from using quantities that 
rely on the ATLAS PV was made.  

\par As shown in Chapter~\ref{obj}, the fit method used to reconstruct tracks is different 
from that used to reconstruct electron tracks in the ID. In addition, the measured ID hits for 
muons candidates may be different as the combined MS+ID track fit is used for CB muons. Thus, 
matching tracks to leptons in necessary. A track was considered matched to a lepton track if it 
satisfied the following conditions :
\begin{enumerate}
\item passes all track quality selection criteria;
\item has at least 2~\GeV\ in \pt;
\item $\Delta z_0(\text{track,lepton})$ is less than 1 mm;
\item and $\Delta R(\text{track,lepton})$ is less than 0.01.
\end{enumerate}   
In the case where a track is matched to both leptons in the event, preference is given to the lepton 
closest in $z_0$, measured with respect to the beamline. Figure~\ref{fig:trkMatch} shows the number of tracks 
matched to electrons and muons in the  simulated signal sample of events. Electrons, since they undergo 
brehmsstrahlung at a higher rate than muons, have a larger fraction of two matched tracks than muons. It 
is not expected to match 3 or more tracks to either of the leptons.

\end{subfigure} 
\caption{Plots showing the number of tracks matched to the electron (left) and the muon (right) tracks}
\label{fig:trkMatch}
\end{figure}

\par To ensure that the two leptons in the event are indeed from the di-lepton 
vertex, their $z_0$ positions, $z_0^1$ and $z_0^2$, were required to be within 1 mm of each other. 
The 1 mm value was arrived at after measuring the $z_0$ resolution in both data and simulation and 
observing that they safely agree within 1 mm. The position of the di-lepton vertex in $z_0$, $z^{av}_0$, was then 
taken as the average of $z_0^1$ and $z_0^2$. Tracks not matched to either of the leptons 
were tested for absolute distance in $z_0$ from $z_0^{av}$. Figure~\ref{fig:exclCartoon} 
illustrates this geometry. For \DZ, the closest unmatched track (also referred to as an {\it extra} track) 
was required to be at least 1 mm way from $z_0^{av}$.

\label{fig:exclCartoon}
\end{figure}

\par Although \DZ\ was observed to be sensitive to pileup events, the signal selection 
efficiency in the pileup range expected during the Run I data taking period was not terrible. At 
worst the signal efficiency was about 50\%, when the number of pileup events ($\mu$) was 
greater than 30. During Run I, the average number of pileup events was 20.7. Figure~\ref{fig:pileupEff} 
shows the signal efficiency of this selection, simulated using FPMC, plotted against 
the number of pileup event, $\mu$. For $\mu=20.7$, the efficiency was found to be around 58\% 
in simulation. The was compared to the efficiency measured in data, as discussed in the 
next section.
