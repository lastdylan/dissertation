\chapter{Charged Higgs Search}
\label{chargedH}
\begin{chapabstract}
A search for evidence of the charged Higgs boson from LHC collisions is 
presented in this chapter. Potential charged Higgs boson masses were scanned from 200 
to 2000~\GeV. Observations in this data-set indicate that it is consistent with the Standard 
Model predictions, rather than predictions from the hMSSM. Exclusion limits were 
set on the production cross section of the charged 
Higgs boson times the branching ratio of its decay to a $\tau$ lepton and a $\tau$ neutrino.  
In Section~\ref{sec:samplesCh} the data-sets used in the search are presented. Data obtained from 
LHC collisions is referred to as {\it data}, while data obtained from simulation is just referred to 
as {\it simulation}. In Section~\ref{sec:objCh} physics object selection criteria are presented, adding to the 
 criteria presented in Chapter~\ref{obj}. In Section~\ref{sec:evSelCh} the 
criteria to select events with a charged Higgs boson 
signature are introduced. Treatment of backgrounds to the charged Higgs boson is discussed in 
Section~\ref{sec:bkgCh}, with the associated systematic uncertainties discussed in Section~\ref{sec:systsCh}. 
Final event yields are presented in Section~\ref{sec:resCh}, and their statistical assessment is 
discussed in the same section.
% It should be acknowledged that the treatment of background processes was 
%a collaborative effort, of which the author is proud to have contributed significantly.

%\begin{chapsummary}
%A search for evidence of the charged Higgs boson in the decay 
%channel $H^+\to\tau\nu$, in association with a top quark, was performed in 14.7~\ifb 
%of $pp$ collision data collected by the ATLAS detector. The data was found to be 
%consistent with the Standard Model prediction, as opposed to the hMSSM model presented 
%in Chapter~\ref{theory}. Exclusion limits were set on the product of the production 
%cross section of the charged Higgs boson and the branching ratio of its decay to a 
%$\tau$ lepton and a $\nu_\tau$, for charged Higgs boson masses in the range 200$\to$2000~\GeV. 
%In the hMSSM context, $\tan\beta=60$ values are excluded for the charged Higgs boson 
%mass range $200\to 540~\GeV$. As the ATLAS detector keeps on collecting more data, 
%results for this search keep on evolving.
